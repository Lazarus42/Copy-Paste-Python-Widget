The current issue is continuously monitoring the keyboard input. Terminal is saying that this requires administrative privileges. I'll try to fix this.

I will have to have a file that I write to and from in order for this to work. 
I'm not sure if saving the global information in the file itself is a good idea.


Update: The previous problem is fixed.
Now, the issue is that it requires trying to copy something two times before it gets added to the copy queue. The problem seems to come from the 
prev_copied variable getting updated too soon?
